  - ✅ Modulesap/base/i18n/ResourceBundle
  - ✅ Data binding via a resource model

**Feedback:**
- **Correct:** Correct! You can use thesap/base/i18n/ResourceBundlemodule to load locale-specific files from the server and access the texts of it. A resource model can be used to bind controls to translatable texts. A resource model supports only property bindings.

#### Question 2
- **Lesson:** Working with a Resource Model
- **Type:** singleselect (Code: 2)
- **Question:** Which parameter is used to pass the SAPUI5 module name of the base.propertiesfile to aResourceModel?
**Options:**
  - ❌ bundle
  - ✅ bundleName
  - ❌ bundleUrl
  - ❌ url

**Feedback:**
- **Correct:** Correct! ThebundleNameparameter is used to pass the SAPUI5 module name of the base.propertiesfile in dot notation to aResourceModel.

#### Question 3
- **Lesson:** Working with a Resource Model
- **Type:** singleselect (Code: 2)
- **Question:** You have created a resource model for an SAPUI5 component using neither thesupportedLocalesparameter nor thefallbackLocaleparameter. Assume that SAPUI5 determinesde_DEas the locale for the application at runtime. In this case, which is the locale fallback chain used by SAPUI5 when loading resource bundle files (where "" stands for the raw file)?
**Options:**
  - ❌  "de_DE" → "de" → ""
  - ✅  "de_DE" → "de" → "en" → ""
  - ❌  "de_DE" → "de" → "" → "en"
  - ❌  "de" → "de_DE" →  ""

**Feedback:**
- **Correct:** Correct! To load the language-dependent text for a used key, the filei18n_de_DE.propertieswould first be requested from the server. If this is not found or the used key is not present there, the filei18n_de.propertieswould be requested next (without region suffix). If this is not found or the key used is not present there, thei18n_en.propertiesfile would be requested next. If no value for the key can be identified via this request either, the raw file,i18n.properties, is finally requested from the server.
